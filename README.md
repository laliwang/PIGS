## 🏠 Abstract

Planar structures, ubiquitous in man-made indoor environments, enable compact and accurate scene decomposition. Recent methods distill planar features into learning-based MVS geometries for multi-view 3D plane estimation. However, the implicit nature of planar features hinders the semantic–geometry alignment within individual planar instances, resulting in distorted geometry and fragmented semantics. To address this, we propose PIGS, the first Planar-Instance Gaussian Splatting framework that explicitly targets planar instances and enforces planar semantic–geometry alignment through planar structural priors, free from feature distillation. Starting from planar-unaware geometry, our method first employs the GHPS module to achieve annotation-free single-view planar segmentation, then utilizes the MVSA module to perform multi-view instance association and planarity aggregation, and finally leverages the PIGO module to initialize and optimize Planar-Instance Gaussian primitives (PIGs) through planar-aware loss functions during instance-level splatting. Followed by a planar-aware ball-pivoting strategy for final plane mesh extraction, PIGS produces semantically and geometrically aligned 3D planes, closely matching RGB references. Extensive experiments on hundreds of indoor scenes and comprehensive ablations demonstrate the superior performance, while module-agnostic evaluations and outdoor experiments validate its generalization capability.

## 🏃 Run

### Bash Script

For efficiency considerations, we reorganize the PIGS pipeline into 6 bash scripts per scene, and expose a minimal and flexible interface that allows users to easily adapt the pipeline to their own directory structures.

**1.ScanNetV2: PIGS/bashes/ScanNetV2/scannet.json**
```json
{   
    "scene": "scene_name",    # "like scene0678_00"
    "cudaid": "0",
    "Code_path": "/path/to/PIGS",
    "Data_path": "/path/to/PIGS_data",
    "Data_type": "ScanNetV2",
    "conda_sh": "/path/to/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh",
    "ray_tmp": "/path/to/tmp",
    "Weights_path": "/path/to/PIGS/weights",
    "use_proxy": true
  }
```

**2.ScanNet++: PIGS/bashes/ScanNet++/scannetpp.json**
```json
{   
    "scene": "scene_name",    # "like 785e7504b9"
    "cudaid": "0",
    "Code_path": "/path/to/PIGS",
    "Data_path": "/path/to/PIGS_data",
    "Data_type": "ScanNet++",
    "conda_sh": "/path/to/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh",
    "ray_tmp": "/path/to/tmp",
    "Weights_path": "/path/to/PIGS/weights",
    "Token": "your_token (obtained via application)",
    "use_proxy": true
  }
```

**Notice:** the `use_proxy` flag is used if you are using a proxy for network access. If `true`, then you need to change the port in each `*.sh` file to your proxy port. And to load path parameters from json, `jq` is required on your machine.

```bash
sudo apt-get install jq
```

## ❓ FAQ / Common Questions
### Q-1: Installing `renderpy` fails due to missing system `LibGL`?

If the system `LibGL` cannot be found when installing `renderpy`, please declare the following environment variables **before** running `pip install .`:

```bash
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr
export CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
export CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include
```

### Q2: Installing `diff-plane-rasterization` fails due to missing `crypt.h`?

When installing the third-party library `diff-plane-rasterization` in the PIGO module, the build may fail because `crypt.h` cannot be found.  
In this case, please run the following commands:

```bash
cp /usr/include/crypt.h /path/to/pigs_envs/include/crypt.h
export CPATH=/path/to/pigs_envs/include
pip install -e .
```
